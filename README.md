# camp3d

What is it?
-----------
It's a very much work-in-progress, not fit for use, currently a bit rubbish 3D engine for Pico8

When will it be finished?
-------------------------
Who knows?  Maybe never.

Why "camp3d"?
-------------
Because I started it while camping out in the back garden one night with the kids.
